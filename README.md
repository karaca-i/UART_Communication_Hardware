# UART_Communication_Hardware

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a communication protocol commonly used for serial communication between two devices. UART allows for the transmission and reception of data between devices using two wires (transmit and receive), along with a ground connection. 

UART is simulated by using 2 different Basys-3 Chipset, where both of them can receive and transmit data in 8-bit (1-byte) packages. The communication is asynchronous, meaning that the transmitting and receiving devices do not have a common clock signal. Instead, they agree on a specific baud rate (the speed of data transmission) to communicate with each other.
